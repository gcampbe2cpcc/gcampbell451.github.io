		<ul>
			<li><b>What is the company/organization?</b></li>
				<p>The website I will review is CivFanatics.com.</p>
			<li><b>What is the URL?</b></li>
				<p>The URL for the site is <a href="https://www.civfanatics.com/">civfanatics.com</a></p>
			<li><b>What is the purpose of the site?</b></li>
				<p>The purpose of the site is to provide information about the line of Sid Meyer's six Civilization games. There are forums 
				   both for general discussion and specific game-related questions for all the Civ games, the first of which was
				   released in 1991. Users can download mods or game saves, and the forum discussions provide a massive trove of detailed
				   information about gameplay that could only be learned with hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of play.</p>
			<li><b>Who is the intended audience?</b></li>
				<p>The intended audience is any person who has in the past or may in the future play this highly addictive game. The audience
				   seems mostly male given the demographics of the forum posters, but any detail-oriented person who likes SimCity-style
				   games would be right at home on the site.</p>
			<li><b>Do you believe the site reaches its audience?</b></li>
				<p>I very much believe the site reaches its audience. The game can be quite complicated and on the higher difficulty levels 
				   quite frustrating. There are dozens of interrelated game mechanics and navigating all of that is much harder without
				   the expert information found on the site. I find myself reading forum posts I'm not specifically interested in because
				   often a tidbit or two arises that helps me in unexpected areas of the game.</p>
			<li><b>Was the site useful to you?</b></li>
				<p>The site was and is very useful to me. I have a greater appreciation of the complexities of the game and often learn
				   new and interesting ways to play it. The game is so open-ended that having other players' knowledge and experience a 
				   button-click away has saved me literally hundreds of hours of going down the wrong path.</p>
			<li><b>List the colors and/or graphics that are used on the home page of this website.</b></li>	
				<p>Background-color: #FFFFFF everywhere. There is a graphic in the header
				   that is a snip from the front of the box of the newest release, Civilization 6. There are often embedded YouTube videos
				   showing new developer content. Only the Home navigation button has a different color than the other links and graphics aren't used.
				   Most of the color on the home page comes from the ads. </p>
			<li><b>How does the use of color and graphics enhance the website?</b></li>	
				<p>The site is not terribly stylistically interesting. Like I said, Background-color: #FFFFFF everywhere. There are several different font sizes
				   that help break up the page visually, but it's clear the site developers didn't spend a ton of time on the CSS. The site is
				   utilitarian in concept, so spartan design is unsurprising.</p>
