	<p>The site I wish to create is one dedicated to the UNC-Chapel Hill men's basketball team and its history.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The purpose of the site is to pay tribute to the men's basketball program at UNC. I want the site to
			be a source of information and build excitement and interest about the program. In particular, the site 
			will showcase the seasons in which the team won the National Championship.</li>
		<li>The intended audience is the intersection of college basketball fans and people who have an allegiance
		    to the University.</li>
		<li>Content included in the site will be statistics both from the overall history of the program and from the individual
			seasons when the team won the National Championship. There is likely to be biographical information about coaches
			and perhaps some prominent players. I intend to give a synopsis of the title seasons, and include pictures of players and 
			coaches if I can do so without copyright issues.</li>
		<li>Similar or related sites include <a href="https://goheels.com/index.aspx">goheels.com</a>,
