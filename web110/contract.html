		<p>Gregory C. Campbellâ€™s WEB110 Course Contract</p>
		<p>I, Gregory C. Campbell, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Summer 2020 WEB110_85 Internet/Web Fundamentals course with my instructor, 
				D. I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate 
			for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		<p>Signed, <a href="introduction.html">Gregory Carlisle Campbell</a>, May 26, 2020</p>
